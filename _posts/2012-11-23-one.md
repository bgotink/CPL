## Introduction

__Mister B.__
Mister B. is an experienced C-programmer at C-Coders. All the programs that are developed in this company are written in C. And Mister B. loves that. In his student years, Mister B. also came into contact with Java. However, he already knew the language C and he only learned Java because he had to. In his opinion, C is the best language and there’s no need to discuss that.  

__Denis L.__
Denis has just graduated from the university and is eager to start with a new chapter in his life: going to work. Today is his first day at work and he’s meeting with Mister B, the leader of his assigned team. At the university, Denis came in contact with just one programming language, namely Java. How he got passed the interviews without any knowledge of C remains a mystery. But that’s that. Today is the day that Denis can ask everything about C to Mister B. 

## Conversation

__Hey mister B, this may be a stupid question, but how do I create an object in C?__  
Simple answer, you can’t. C is not an object-oriented language but a procedural one.  There are, however, certain structures in this language which allow you to create object-like structures. They only contain data, no methods or other typical object-oriented members.  

__A procedural language, you say?__ 
In a procedural programming, you typically break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures and subroutines. In object-oriented programming on the other hand, you break it down into objects that expose behaviour (methods) and data (variables) using interfaces. In an object-oriented language like Java, an instance of a class, operates on its own data structure. In C, all data is exposed[2].  

__You mentioned something about object-like structures?__  
Yeah, they’re called structures and are defined using the keyword struct. Let me give an example.
```C
struct Address {
	char *streetName;
	int number, postalCode;
	char *city, *state, *country;
};
```
This piece of C code defines a structure containing strings and integers. You can easily create new variables of this structure type using
```C
struct Address homeAddress;
```

However, this requires writing “struct Address” every time you want to declare a new variable of that type. You can also create the same structure using:
```C
typedef struct {
	char *streetName;
	int number, postalCode;
	char *city, *state, *country;
} Address;
```
Creating new Address variables is now simply
```C
Address homeAddress;
```
